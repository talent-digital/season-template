# talent::digital season template

Use this template to create a new season for the [talent::digital](https://www.talentdigital.eu) platform and to get any changes automatically installed through a [Github action](https://github.com/talent-digital/deploy-season) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Please note that you need an own Netlify account. Free plans are available.

## üêé Getting Started

0. Contact support@talentdigital.eu to request an **episode provisioner client password**. The password will permit deployment of new content into your talent::digital tenant using the Github action.
1. Create a repository using this template.
2. Run `npm install` or `pnpm install` or `yarn install` to install the [@talentdigital/season](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@talentdigital/season) package.
3. Add your **tenant id** into an [enviroment actions variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables) as `TENANT_ID`. The tenant ID is the first part of your talent::digital URL. E.g., if you URL is *mytenant.talentdigital.eu*, the tenant ID is *mytenant*.
4. Add your **episode provisioner client password** into an [actions secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) under `EPISODES_PROVISIONER_CLIENT_PASSWORD`.
5. Replace [assets/season.svg](/assets/season.svg) with your own season image.
6. [Add your new repository to your Netlify account](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).
7. Optional: Customise your _site name_ on Netlify to get a custom Netlify URL. 
8. Add your season configuration into the [season.yaml](/season.yaml) file, adding your **Netlify URL** under the key **assetsURL**.
9. Commit and push your changes to the **main** branch to deploy the season to the platform.

Note: Pull requests and changes on branches will not be deployed to your talent::digital tenant. This way, you can safely test your changes without interferring with deployed content. See [talentkit](https://github.com/talent-digital/talentkit) for more information.
