# talent::digital season template

Use this template to create a new season for the [talent::digital](https://www.talentdigital.eu) platform.

You will need to obtain a **tenant id**, and a **episode provisioner client password** from talent::digital.

The [deploy season](https://github.com/talent-digital/deploy-season) github action is preconfigured to deploy your season to the talent::digital platform.

## üêé Getting Started

1. Create a repository using this template.
2. Add your **tenant id** into an [enviroment actions variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables) as `TENANT_ID`.
3. Add your **episode provisioner client password** into an [actions secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) under `EPISODES_PROVISIONER_CLIENT_PASSWORD`.
4. Replace [assets/season.svg](/assets/season.svg) with your own season image.
5. Add your season configuration into the [season.yaml](/season.yaml) file.
6. Commit and push your changes to the **main** branch.
